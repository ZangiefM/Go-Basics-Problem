Go Basics Problem Set
Overview
This repository contains a set of basic problems implemented in Go. The purpose of this project is to help beginners learn Go programming concepts and improve problem-solving skills through practice.

Features
Simple and easy-to-understand problems suitable for beginners.
Each problem focuses on a specific concept or technique in Go programming.
Solutions provided for each problem to facilitate learning and understanding.
Test cases included to verify the correctness of the solutions.
Problem statements and solutions are well-documented for clarity.
Problems Included
Hello, World!: Print "Hello, World!" to the console.
Sum of Two Numbers: Calculate and print the sum of two given numbers.
Factorial of a Number: Calculate and print the factorial of a given number.
Reverse a String: Reverse a given string and print the result.
Check Palindrome: Check if a given string is a palindrome or not.

Count Words in a String: Count and print the number of words in a given string.
Check Prime Number: Check if a given number is prime or not and print the result.
Usage
Each problem is implemented in a separate Go file (problem1.go, problem2.go, etc.). To run the solution for a specific problem, simply execute the corresponding Go file using the go run command. For example:

go
Copy code
go run Name-of-the-file.go
This will execute the solution for the first problem and print the output.
